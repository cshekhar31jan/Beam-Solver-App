# Beam-Solver-App
This app analyze beam structure from input (image/data driven input) and compute some typical values associated with it.




//
The idea is to design an App that can solve the beam using different methods of beam solving.
The methods are moment area method, slope deflection method and matrix displacement method to calculate deflection, slope, shear and bending moment at any point of the beam so that we can identify critical parts of beam which are most deflected and bended.

The idea is also that this App runs on different platforms â€“ Desktop/ Laptop (OS X, Windows, Linux),  Android Devices (mobiles and tablets), iOS devices (iPad and iPhones) etc. and for this purpose we have chosen Kivy Framework.
